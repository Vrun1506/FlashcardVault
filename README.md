## Welcome
This is my EdTech business selling the A level flashcards, which I created and used while studying for my A level exams, at affordable prices. 

My aim is to help as many people ace their exams, one card at a time. 

Making flashcards can be a long and tedious process and I designed my website to facilitate this process by providing premium quality flashcards that have been tried and tested by my friends and I.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
