This is Flashcard Vault, an AI-powered flashcard generation tool that takes you from a PDF to a set of Anki flashcards in a matter of minutes. 

Perfect for when you have to create resources for exams, and saves you so much time!

Tech stack: TypeScript, Python, Next.js, FastAPI, Firebase.

Things to do: 

1) Finish setting up my frontend (log in page, demo page, contact page and add links to all pages)
2) Set up authentication with Firebase
3) Sort out API stuff with LLMs and things. Sort out prompt and how I'm going to mess around there. 
4) See if I have a legitimate purpose for incorporating LangChain into this. 
5) Figure out storage solution for flashcards (maybe OCI or AWS?)
6) See if it's worth putting behind a paywall.
