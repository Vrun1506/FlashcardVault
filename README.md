## Welcome
This is my EdTech business selling the A level flashcards, which I created and used while studying for my A level exams, at affordable prices. 

My aim is to help as many people ace their exams, one card at a time. 

Making flashcards can be a long and tedious process and I designed my website to facilitate this process by providing premium quality flashcards that have been tried and tested by my friends and I.



## Installation

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vrun1506/FlashcardVault

```

3) Download the Python packages by running the following commands:
